S_OPENAL_UpdateOcclusion

HZM coop - OCCLUSION: muffle 3D sounds whose path to the listener is blocked by world
geometry. A 3-ray fan (direct + two lateral offsets) gives partial occlusion in thirds;
traces are staggered per channel (s_obstruction_cal_time ms, a previously-dead Miles-era
cvar), and the value is smoothed per frame before driving an EFX lowpass on the direct
path. The reverb send stays unfiltered - hearing an occluded sound through the room
is exactly right when the env reverb is on.
